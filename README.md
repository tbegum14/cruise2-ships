Cruise Ships Project

Demonstrate use of object oriented programming and the interaction of objects to allow cruise ships to operate.

Ship, Port and Itinerary are objects

Itinerary contains an array of ports

Ship is initialised with the current port in itinerary as its current port, it can set sail and dock at the other ports in the itinerary. Once on the last port it will notify that you have reached the end. 

Port has a name and can hold a ship. It has a method to add and remove ships which is done via Ship.js

The GUI displays a message as you begin and move from port to port and a display letting you know where you are.

The form can take input and add a port to the itinerary.

TDD used to develop programme

Test files include dummies, stubs and spies
